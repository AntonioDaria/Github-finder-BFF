```

```

I can press submit and see the results on the same page
```


## What's been accomplished ‚úÖ

- The Form take a user name to search for the user favourite language, sends the query to the backend API, which  returns the user favourite language 

## What's left to do on the current output ‚ö†Ô∏è

- Improve error handling 
- Improve Tests for service on the API and for the service on the front end

## Nice to haves üí´

- Bring back more values from the backend to create a better experience to the user

## Scaling up ‚è´

- In a typical SOA architecture the code would have been split into two different microservices for the pourpose of this exercise the code was made all in   one repo

## Getting started

```
cd  into the root folder and run npm i
cd  into the client folder and run npm i
```

Run development server (on port 5000)

### Technologies used

- React
- Axios to make HTTP requests
- React hooks for components state management
- concurrently to run simultaneously frontend and backend
- Node js
- Express
- Jest 

### Testing

- All the current tests are passing. The tests from back end and front end will need to be run independently :
- For Front end testing navigate to the client folder and run npm run test press a for all tests
- For Backend test navigate to the root folder and run npm run test, you will see the back end tests passing and for some reason
2 front end test not passing. I am unsure as to why this is happening. Alternatively run the test individually like so.:
npm run test <'filename'>
